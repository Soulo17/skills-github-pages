    <b><center><b><H1>A LITTLE ABOUT MY PERSONALITY:</H1></b></center><br>
	<center><p>Having terrible anxiety significantly shaped me into a very negative and reserved individual. The anxiety  impacts my academic life, both positively and negatively.<br>
	As an Idealist, I am deeply driven by meaning, integrity, and personal growth, which makes me passionate about learning and self-improvement.<br> 
	I genuinely want to do well, not just for the sake of grades but because I value the knowledge and its impact on myself and others. However, my anxiety often gets in the way of this idealism.<p></center>

    <Center><H1>A quote from Kendrick Lamar:</H1></Center><br>
<Center><p>My Hero and favourite artist is Kendrick lamar.  one of my favourite quotes from him is "Kendrick made you think about it, but he is not your savior".<br> While it may seem simple, this line from his song is very important.  
We often worship celebrities and view them as visionary because of their influence.<br> This line highlight the importance of a celebrity showing that he is not the answer to your problems, he's just a flawed and prone to make mistakles like everyone else.<p></Center>

<center> <p>The survey results indicate that I am an Idealist, which mostly aligns with my self-perception.The description emphasizes values such as meaning, integrity, and human development, which resonate with me.<br> 
   I do see myself as someone who seeks relational harmony, enjoys mentoring others, and values personal growth. Additionally, the idea of needing meaningful work and connections is something I strongly relate to.<br></p></center> 

<center><p>However, while the overall outcome feels accurate, I did notice that some of the questions seemed repetitive, only worded differently. 
   This could have been an intentional method to ensure consistency in responses or<br> to elicit slightly different nuances in answers. 
   If that was the case, it makes sense as a technique for increasing the reliability of the results.</p></center> 
<center><p>Overall, I am satisfied with the outcome and think the test has a reasonable level of validity, though like any personality assessment, it might not capture every complexity of an individual.</p></center></b>
