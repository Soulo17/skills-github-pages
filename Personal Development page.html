<center><H1>Reflection & Application to Anxiety:</H1></center>
<br>
<br>
<center><p>After carefully reading Chapters 4 – 7 of “Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener; I can honestly say that they provided practical wisdom that can help manage anxiety, especially in academic life.<br> 
           Anxiety often comes from feeling overwhelmed, disorganized, or uncertain about the future. By applying these principles, I can create a structured, goal-oriented approach to my studies and personal growth.</center></p><br>
		   
<ul>
<p><li><center>Goal Setting to Reduce Overwhelm: Anxiety makes it easy to feel lost or aimless. By setting clear, step-by-step goals (as suggested in Chapter 4), I can break down overwhelming tasks into manageable steps, reducing stress.</center></li></p>
<p><li><center>Time Management to Avoid Anxiety Spirals: Poor time management can make anxiety worse. Chapter 5 teaches how to prioritize tasks, which helps me avoid last-minute stress and panic. Creating a study schedule and setting deadlines for small tasks can help me stay in control.</center></li></p>
<p><li><center>Surrounding Myself with Positive People: Anxiety can make it hard to believe in myself. Chapter 6 reminds me that the right support system—mentors, encouraging friends, or study groups—can help boost confidence and motivation. Being around those who uplift and challenge me in a positive way can make a big difference.</center></li></p>
<p><li><center>Continuous Learning for Self-Confidence: A big part of my anxiety comes from feeling like I’m not good enough. Chapter 7’s focus on lifelong learning encourages me to keep improving at my own pace. Instead of fearing failure, I can see mistakes as learning opportunities.</center></li></p>
</ul>
<br>
<center>By applying these lessons, I can manage my anxiety better, build self-discipline, and create a mindset that focuses on growth rather than fear.</center>
